# 2dengine.cpp
After learning most of the basics of C++, I am venturing to see how a 2D game engine can be made using C++, and SDL libraries.

## Setup

### Install msys2 c++ compiler
https://www.msys2.org/

Add enviornment variable of the compiler bin to PATH
```
C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin
```

### Building
Simply run in the terminal to generate the .exe
```
./make.sh
```
